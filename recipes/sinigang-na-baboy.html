                <h2><strong>Steps:</strong></h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil a lot of water in a pot. Add the pork belly slices and parboil them for a few minutes. Once the white scum or the impurities float, remove them and discard.</li>
                    <li>In another pan, add the parboiled pork (no oil) and sear them until the natural oil from the fat is rendered.</li>
                    <li>Add the onions and 2 tomatoes. Saute them for a few minutes together with the pork. Add some rice water (or plain water) as needed to cover the pork. Add the gabi and submerge them in the broth to cook. Cover the pot and let it simmer for a few minutes using medium heat until the pork is tender.</li>
                    <li>When the gabi is soft, mash some of them and then mix in the broth to thicken it a little and make it extra flavorful.</li>
                    <li>Add the sliced radish to the broth and let them simmer until cooked. Then, add the string beans and okra. Stir a little and let the veggies submerge in the broth. Cook for a few more minutes. Season with some salt or fish sauce based on your liking.</li>
                    <li>Then, add the long green chilies and the kangkong leaves. Submerge the leaves in the broth to cook and soften. Add the rest of the tomatoes for color and fresh flavor.</li>
                    <li>Let this cook for a few more minutes. Once the ingredients come together, the dish is ready! Turn the heat off.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the pork sinigang to a serving bowl. Enjoy this as a soup or have this with some hot steaming rice. Yum!</li>
